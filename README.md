# odin-recipes
I'm gonna put to practice some of the basisc to create a html document (webpage)

		Text: How to create a:
			Paragraph
			Give some kinda style to the the through:				
				<strong>
				<em>
				<h1-6>
			Put link and images
			Create ordered and unordered and descriptive lists.
				<ol>
				<ul>
					<li>
				<dl>
					<dt>
					<dd>

	HOW'S GONNA WORK (LITTLE draft )
		
			

		The presentation page: Purpose of this project
			With the link to every recipe
		3 recipes each one with a web page
			Containing a previous and next recipe button
			Principal site button

			IMPORTAN!!!!!!!!!!

			IF YOU'RE CREATING WEB PAGES THAT WILL FOLLOW THE SAME PATTERN YOU'D LIKELY WANT TO CREATE A MODEL ONCE AND THEN COPY AND PASTE IT
			LATER SO YOU CAN FILL IT WITH THE INFO THAT DIFFERENTIATE IT FROM THE OTHERS
